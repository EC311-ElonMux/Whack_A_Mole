Here are 4 testbenches, which made up most of the testing that we had done for this project. However, they are incredibly outdated,
as the testbenches were created near the start of the project to check that a basic idea works, and then as the project advanced after
pushing the files to the board, debugging and changes were done using the FPGA board, not testbenches.

With t_lfsr we just needed to check that the code was actually giving out a pseudo random sequence

t_gameplay and t_molepicker were ways to see if we were actually able to use these pseudo random sequences to
get a mole, and then detect when the moles and input match eachother to increment score. In fact gameplay.v was actually completely
phased out of the project for another module, which is why it's .v is included inside of this file.

t_counter was just a quick module to check that the signal we are using to signal that a mole should pop up is working.

A large reason for there only being 4 testbenches for this project is because a lot of the concepts that were applied in labs 1-4 were
incorporated over, such as the counter from lab 4, VGA code and the edge detection for the switches from Lab 3. Testbenches for those 
concepts were made earlier, and not imported over.
